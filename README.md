# Ticket-Management-System
"The Ticket Management System is a web-based application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to book tickets by entering the source (From Location) and destination (To Location). The interface is user-friendly, with input fields to enter travel details and a button to confirm the booking.

Once a ticket is booked, it is stored in the browser's memory (local storage or JavaScript array) and can be viewed later in the ticket history section. Users can click a "View History" button to see a list of all their previously booked tickets."
